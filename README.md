# Daigaku

Daigaku (大学) is the Japanese word for **university**.

With Daigaku you can master your way of learning the Ruby programming
language with courses that are created by the community.

Daigaku is a command line tool and a text based interface and provides
you with a number of learning tasks and explanations about the Ruby
programming language. You will learn Ruby step by step by solving small
language-explaining programming tasks.

## Installation

First of all make sure Ruby is installed on your computer.

Then open a terminal and install Daigaku by running:

    $ gem install daigaku

## Get started

To get started open a terminal and run following line:

    $ daigaku welcome

Daigaku will lead you through the setup and some important commands.

## Command line interface

Daigaku's command line interface provides several commands which you
can use in your terminal to setup the system, download new courses,
and navigate through your solutions.

Please visit the [Daigaku Wiki](https://github.com/daigaku-ruby/daigaku/wiki/How-to-use-Daigaku%27s-command-line-interface-%28CLI%29) to learn more about available commands.

## Daigaku screen

Daigaku's text based interface - the Daigaku screen - shows your installed courses and allows you to navigate through their chapters and units. In the task view you can read the unit's task and validate your solution code.

Please visit the [Diagaku Wiki](https://github.com/daigaku-ruby/daigaku/wiki/How-to-learn-Ruby-in-the-Daigaku-screen) to learn how to use the Daigaku screen.
